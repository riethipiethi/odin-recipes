<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Baking sourdough bread for me is not only about the food. It's also about the
    process of baking and caring for your sourdough. In this recipe I 
    will share with you my way of making my first sourdough and how I take care
    of it :) 
</p>

<h2>Starting your first sourdough</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 glass jar (minimum 400ml)</li>
    <li>1 kitchen cloth</li>
    <li>100g rye flour (full grain if possible)</li>
    <li>100ml water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix water and rye flour in the glass jar. For stirring I prefer to use
        wooden spoons, but everything works.
    </li>
    <li>Cover the jar with the kitchen cloth and let it rest in a warm spot for
        some days. You can check in between if things are starting to become
        bubbly.
    </li>
    <li>The sourdough is ready to use when it has grown to about twice its original
        size.
    </li>
    <li>Let's bake some bread!</li>
    <li>When you're done with the starter close the lid of the jar and put it in
        your fridge. Now you only need to <a href="#feeding">feed it</a> every 
        7-10 days.
    </li>
</ol>
