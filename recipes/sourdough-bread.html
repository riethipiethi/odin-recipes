    <p class = "description">Sourdough bread is one of the most tasty breads I have tried. Plus it is super fun
        to make yourself. Today I want to share with you my go-to sourdough bread recipe.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500 g sourdough</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Salt</li>
    <li>200 g rye flour</li>
    <li>300 g wheat flour</li>
    <li>200 ml water</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix all the ingredients in a big bowl until you have a rough loaf.
        Afterwards knit the loaf for a few minutes on the kitchen counter until
        it becomes nice and smooth. If needed spray some extra flour on the kitchen 
        counter so the dough does not stick to it. 
    </li>
    <li>Form a nice loaf and put it on an oven tray with baking paper. Now cover 
        the loaf with a kitchen towel or some other cloth and let it rest until
        the loaf has grown to about twice the original size. This can take up to
        6 hours depending on temperature and flour used.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Put a small bowl with water next to the bread
        and bake it for about 60 minutes. Knocking on the bread should give a hollow
        sound when the bread is done. Let it now cool out on an oven grate. 
    </li>
</ol>
